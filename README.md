### I see you found me 👨‍💻

**Heads up**: my projects are usually to learn/test stuff and just for myself, so I almost never finish them.

-   🔭 I love to work on new languages and test out new stuff!
-   📚 I’m currently learning Angular, Unit Testing (Jest/Cypress) and Firebase. I also want to take a dive into ReactJS, VueJS and Redux among others.
