    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Francesc Xavier Caro Miro, I'm from Palma, Spain, and was born in March 1996.
      I go by either likefurnis (my old username) or Gummie (the latest one), though
      this one is usually taken, so it may vary a little.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Dev</h2>
    <p>
      I consider myself a <b>full stack developer</b>. However, I realized that what I love the most, is either
      <b>DevOps</b> or <b>frontend</b> with <b>Angular</b>, mainly <b>UI/UX</b>. I also enjoy developing in <b>.NET Core</b>. I've
      also worked with <b>Java</b> and <b>ORACLE</b>, but the main projects I work on, are made with <b>Angular, .NET Core and SQL</b>.
      I also do enjoy <b>vanilla JavaScript</b>!
    </p>
    <p>
      I use WakaTime to register the time I spend developing either on VSCode, VS2019 or MSSQL. Here you can see my stats for this week:

    </p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I work at a local small company that is growing, <b><a href="https://www.3digits.es/">3digits</a></b>. We mainly develop
      products for our clients from top to bottom.
    </p>
    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently investing some time on having a deeper knowledge on frontend languages, mainly <b>Angular, Ionic and JavaScript</b>.
      I also am learning more about DevOps, like <b>git flow, CI/CD pipelines, automated processes, docker</b> and similars, etc.
      Something completely different that I want to become somewhat good at, or at least have a basic knowledge, is
      <b>Machine Learning</b> and all the different paths it has. I've been using <b>TensorFlow</b> for that. 
    </p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      You can find most of my personal projects <b><a href="https://github.com/likefurnis?tab=repositories&q=&type=public">here</a></b>.
    </p>
    <h3><a href="https://random-skill-generator.web.app/">Random Skill Generator</a></h3>
    <p>
      For my basic website, like this one you're seeing and the project, I use <b><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a></b>,
       where I also have a small project I made for a friend of mine, since he's the Rol Master. It basically was done to make his
        work easier, with the calculations you need to do to determine if an attack hits or not base on stats and so on.
    </p>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/likefurnis/AndPerTag">AndPerTag</a></h3>
    <p>
      I also made a desktop Macro app, where you can have tags to organize them. I made it to learn about desktop apps with Windows Forms,
      and indeed I learned a lot. The problem was that it has a lot of limitations, so I made the first basic version and left it there.
    </p>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/likefurnis/BadKittyBot">BadKittyBot</a> / <a href="https://github.com/likefurnis/ShameBot">ShameBot</a></h3>
    <p>
      I've developed some Discord bots for personal use with vanilla JavaScript. Be adviced though, they are NSFW... They are not
      online because I host them with <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, and when I don't use them, I simply put them offline.
