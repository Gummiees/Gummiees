    <p>
      <strong>Machine Learning (ML) </strong> is the dope new thing that everyone's talking about, because it's really good 
      at learning from data so that it can predict similar things in the future. Doing ML by hand is pretty annoying
      since it usually involves matrix math which is zero fun in JavaScript (or if you ask me: anywhere ðŸ˜…). 
      Thankfully, <strong><a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow.js</a></b> is here to help! It's 
      an open source library that has a lot of built-in Machine Learning-y things like models and algorithms so that 
      you don't have to write them from scratch.

    <h2>Is your problem a Machine Learning problem?</h2>
    <p>Machine Learning is good at classifying and labelling data. The premise of every machine learning problem is:
      <ul>
        <li>Someone gives us some data that was generated according to a <strong>secret</strong> formula. This data could be a bunch 
          of points (that are generated based on some math equation), but could also be fun, like images (the secret 
          formula could be "some of these images are chihuahuas and some are <a href="https://mashable.com/2016/03/10/dog-or-muffin-meme/#LjBd4.e9lgqJ">
          blueberry muffins</a>") or bus schedules.</li>
        <li>By looking at this data we were given, we approximate the secret formula so that we can correctly predict
          a future data point. For example, if we're given a photo, we will eventually be able to confidently say whether it's a dog or a muffin.</li>
      </ul>
